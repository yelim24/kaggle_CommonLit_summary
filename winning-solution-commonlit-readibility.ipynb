    "    \n",
    "So to crack the problem we had, we map each `distinct character` with a `unique number`. Like for `A` it is $1$, for `B` it is $2$, for `a` to be $27$, and many more. So we kind of mapped our `peice of information` in `numbers`. \n",

So the way we know that how many distinct characters are there the `English Language`, what if we somehow get the information of all the distinct `Words` in the `English Language`.

    "$RoBERTa$ $Robustly$ $Optimized$ $BERT$ $Pretraining$ $Approach$ is a $Natural$ $Language$ $Processing$ $Model$ that was introduced in the paper **[RoBERTa: A Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.11692.pdf)** by `Yinhan Liu` et al. in $2019$. It is based on the $BERT$ $Model$, but it makes a number of modifications to the pretraining procedure that improve its performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the key differences between $RoBERTa$ and $BERT$ is that $RoBERTa$ uses a `larger batch size` and a `higher learning rate` during pretraining. This allows $RoBERTa$ to learn `more effectively` from the training data. Additionally, $RoBERTa$ removes the `next sentence prediction task` from the pretraining procedure. This task was originally used in BERT to help the model learn the relationship between sentences, but $RoBERTa$ found that it was `not necessary` for `good performance`.\n",

    "$RoBERTa$ $Large$ is a $Large$ $Language$ $Model$ $(LLM)$ that was `introduced` in the paper **[RoBERTa: A Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.11692.pdf)**. It is a `re-implementation` of the $BERT$ $Model$ that makes a `number of changes` to improve its performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the main changes that $RoBERTa$ makes is to use a `different masking strategy`. In $BERT$, $15$% of the `words` in a sentence are `randomly masked`, and the `model` is then `trained to predict` the `masked words`. $RoBERTa$, on the `other hand`, uses a more `sophisticated` `masking strategy` that takes into account the context of the `masked words`. This helps the `model` to learn better `representations` of `words and their relationships`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another change that $RoBERTa$ makes is to use a `different training objective`. In $BERT$, the model is `trained to predict` the `masked words` and the `next sentence` in a sequence. $RoBERTa$, on the other hand, is only `trained to predict the masked` words. This helps the model to focus on `learning the representations` of words and their relationships, and it also makes the model more robust to noise in the data."
